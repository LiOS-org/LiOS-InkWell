# LiOS-InkWell

InkWell is developed as a core `Rich Text Engine` for LiOS-ecosystem (consists of LiOS-Colors, LiOS-Open and many upcoming)

LiOS-InkWell abstracts most of JS and provides a simple engine that can be utilized to build blogspaces, docs and many more. It provides a set of `modules` which enables developer to only import what is required and avoids bloatware.

Any of the currently implemented features can be previewed in `demo.html`

## Important Note

LiOS-InkWell is in its very early stage, it is not meant to be used in any `production ready` project, future updates will definitely introduce `breaking changes`, most of the implementation methods will change, file's location as well as directory structure might also chanage significantly, these are the reasons we currently dont provide any `documentation`. The documention will be provided once LiOS-InkWell reaches its first stable release.

## Where to track progress

Commits, release tab and the README itselves are the best way to track progress, however in root directory there is a `manifest.json` file which includes most important details about the project including states that are alpha, beta, RC and stable. In future a seperate website will be provided to track status of projects inside `LiOS-org`.
